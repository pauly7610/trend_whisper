## Architecture Overview

```
[frontend] <--> [api-gateway] <--> [trend-analysis] <--> [db]
                              |                |
                              |                +--> [celery-worker] <--> [redis]
                              +--> [audio-processing]
                              +--> [user-management]
```

- **frontend**: React app (port 3000)
- **api-gateway**: Auth, proxy, and routing (port 8000)
- **trend-analysis**: Trend scraping and analytics API (port 8001)
- **celery-worker**: Background scraping jobs
- **audio-processing**: Audio transcription and ML (port 8002)
- **user-management**: User auth/profile service (port 8003)
- **db**: PostgreSQL (port 5432)
- **redis**: Redis (port 6379)

## Quickstart (Docker Compose)

1. **Build and start all services:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. **Access endpoints:**
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - API Gateway: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - Trend Analysis API: [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)
   - Audio Processing API: [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002)
   - User Management API: [http://localhost:8003](http://localhost:8003)
   - PostgreSQL: `localhost:5432` (user: `postgres`, pass: `postgres`, db: `trends`)
   - Redis: `localhost:6379`

3. **Environment variables:**
   - All services are pre-configured for local development via Compose.
   - Update secrets and URLs as needed in `docker-compose.yml` for production.

## Service Details

### trend-analysis
- FastAPI backend for scraping, trend analytics, and DB integration
- Exposes `/fetch-trends`, `/fetch-trends-result/{task_id}` for background scraping
- Uses Celery for long-running jobs (via Redis)

### celery-worker
- Python Celery worker for background scraping jobs
- Shares codebase and dependencies with trend-analysis

### api-gateway
- Node.js Express server
- Handles JWT authentication, proxies requests to backend services

### frontend
- React + Vite app
- Connects to api-gateway for all data/API calls

### audio-processing
- FastAPI backend for audio transcription and ML
- Exposes endpoints for audio file upload and processing

### user-management
- Node.js backend for user authentication and profile management

### db
- PostgreSQL 14-alpine
- Persistent storage for all backend services

### redis
- Redis for Celery broker/result backend and caching

---

## Development Workflow

- All code changes are reflected on rebuild (`docker-compose up --build`).
- For live reload, mount volumes or use dev commands as needed.
- Logs for each service are available via Docker Compose output.

---

## Extending the Stack

- Add new services by creating a Dockerfile and extending `docker-compose.yml`.
- Use environment variables for secrets and inter-service URLs.
- Add healthchecks, monitoring, or reverse proxies as needed.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If a service fails to start, check logs with `docker-compose logs <service>`.
- Ensure Docker Desktop or Docker Engine is running.
- For database migrations or admin, connect to the `db` service using any Postgres client.
